Hi, I'm MaxðŸ‘‹

I have had a lifelong passion for problem-solving, starting from my participation in math and chess competitions during my elementary school years. This interest has only continued to deepen as I have taken on more group projects and leadership roles in organizations such as the University of Waterloo Engineering Society.

During my days, I am either studying Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo, pursuing personal projects, or collaborating with design teams. These experiences allow me to apply my problem-solving skills to actual challenges, which I find incredibly thrilling.
